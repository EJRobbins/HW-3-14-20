                <p>My name is Erica.  I'm a 19 year old who studies at the University of Utah in Sandy.  I never imagined myself coding.  Before I took up any sort of development, I managed a coffee shop and changed majors twice before I even turned 18.  I started studying Biology, then moved to Psychology.  I loved them both, but something was wrong.  I didn't feel challenged, and I didn't feel as if I was making any sort of impact on the world.  After years of coffee and indecisiveness, I quit my job and moved across town to start at a softare development company in Lehi.  This is where I learned my love of development and the quick pace of tech! On this website, you'll find both my contact information, and some of my portfolio projects!  I truly hope you enjoy my little corner of the internet!
